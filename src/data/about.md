# Intro

I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University. I have completed courses in discrete mathematics, object-oriented design, data structures and algorithms, and web development. 
### 
I am particularly interested in web development using Java. Through Spring Boot, I have developed a project called "GuardianAt12 Delivery," which is an Emergency Express STD/HIV Prophylaxis Application designed for the LGBTQ+ community in China to minimize regrets.
### 
Having grown up in China, I deeply sense the distinct tech atmospheres between China and the United States. These interesting differences have made me more open to diverse ideas. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I am dedicated to fostering a more inclusive and diversified development environment. 
### 
I will regularly update this platform with my algorithm notes, technical insights, and learning experiences to document my growth in the tech industry after transitioning careers.

# Before learning computer science

- I hold a Master's degree in finance as well
- I served for a securities company for 5 years and my title used to be vice president. Since bosses would not talk with a newbie, the entry-level was already titled as the sales manager
- I have collaborated with most of China's top real estate fund companies, and through my marketing efforts, the financial assets under the company's custody exceeded 60 billion RMB
- The trade-off was that in the Chinese business environment, I had to drink alcohol frequently with my clients. Alcohol Threshold: 84-proof or 104-proof distilled alcohol ([Baijiu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baijiu)), more than 1 pint

# My Top Five Curiosities About the United States

0. Why do people here wear shorts on snowy days and not use umbrellas on rainy days?
1. Why do Oreos and Lays have fewer flavors here compared to China? Isn't this your home country?
2. Why are antibiotics like cephalosporins, azithromycin, and levofloxacin harder to buy than marijuana? 
3. Cakes here are so sweet that I feel like they can induce plasmolysis in human cells already
4.  "Not" is pronounced too quickly to the point where I can mix up "can" and "can't"
