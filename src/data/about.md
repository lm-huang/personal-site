# Intro

I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University. 
### 
As an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate, I am particularly interested in designing distributed systems and cloud architectures to build more scalable systems with higher availability.
### 
Having grown up in China, I deeply sense the distinct tech atmospheres between China and the United States. These interesting differences have made me more open to diverse ideas. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I am dedicated to fostering a more inclusive and diversified development environment.

# My Top Five Curiosities About the United States

0. Why do people here wear shorts on snowy days and not use umbrellas on rainy days?
1. Why do Oreos and Lays have fewer flavors here compared to China? Isn't this your home country?
2. Why are antibiotics like cephalosporins, azithromycin, and levofloxacin harder to buy than marijuana? 
3. Cakes here are so sweet that I feel like they can induce plasmolysis in human cells already
